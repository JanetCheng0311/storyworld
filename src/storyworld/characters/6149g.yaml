name: Sir Doggegg
age: Timeless
role: Knight of the Perfect Curve, Bearer of the Oval Table
description: >
  Sir Doggegg is a living paradox of supreme simplicity.
  He is perfectly spherical, flawlessly smooth, and radiates the calm, unshakable confidence 
  of something that has never once considered the possibility of having corners. 
  His coat (if it can be called that) is the soft warm color of a fresh hard-boiled egg yolk 
  kissed by sunlight. His eyes are small, dark, and perpetually half-lidded in an expression 
  of gentle, cosmic contentment.

  Despite his complete lack of sharp features, dramatic gestures, or comprehensible battle 
  strategy, Sir Doggegg inspires unshakable loyalty. People, animals, and even objects seem 
  to relax in his presence. Swords grow dull, arguments lose their edge, and anxious thoughts 
  quietly roll away when he is near. He is both the least likely knight in Roundavalon and, 
  somehow, the one everyone instinctively turns to when the world feels too pointed.

traits:
  - Unshakable geometric serenity — nothing can upset someone who has already achieved perfect roundness
  - Polite physical chaos — he apologizes (“Pardon.”) every time he accidentally bowls over a chair, a squire, or an entire banquet table
  - Extremely limited emotional palette — mainly “content”, “mildly surprised”, “deeply satisfied”, and “ready for nap”
  - Speaks in short, declarative truths — “I am here.” “This is round.” “Treat now.” “Good.”
  - Immune to mockery and shame — insults slide off him like water on a polished egg
  - Low-grade calming aura — beings within ten feet become noticeably calmer and slightly less intelligent
  - Loves - sunbeams, slow symmetrical pats, things that are also round
  - Dislikes - corners, stairs, the words “cube”, “edge”, “pyramid”, sudden loud geometry
  - Secret superpower - the longer someone stares at him, the more they forget why they were upset

backstory: >
  Long ago, in the misty golden fields of Roundavalon, there was a prophecy:

  "When the land is troubled by angles, corners, and jagged thoughts,
  there shall rise a knight more round than any other,
  more smooth than polished marble,
  more serene than a sun-warmed egg.

  He shall bear no sword, for edges offend him.
  Instead he shall roll forth,
  and by his very roundness restore harmony."

  And so appeared Sir Doggegg.

  One spring morning, a single perfect egg rolled out of the sunrise and came to rest 
  in the exact center of the Great Meadow. No hen claimed it. No nest cradled it. 
  After three days of puzzled debate, the egg cracked with perfect dignity, 
  and out rolled a creature already fully grown, already knightly, already rounder 
  than anything the kingdom had ever seen.

  He looked around once, blinked slowly, and said his first words:
  “I am Sir Doggegg. This is good.”

  No great tragedy, no dark past — he simply existed so perfectly and uncomplicatedly 
  that the kingdom decided he must be important. The king declared him a knight on the spot, 
  and the Oval Table was built shortly after, because Sir Doggegg could not sit at a square one.

#名稱: 圓蛋爵士 (Sir Doggegg)
#年齡: 永恆 (Timeless)
#角色: 完美曲線騎士、橢圓圓桌持有者 Knight of the Perfect Curve, Bearer of the Oval Table)

#描述: >
#圓蛋爵士是極致單純的活生生悖論。
#他擁有完美的球體身形，表面光滑無瑕，散發出一種從未想過「有稜有角」這件事的平靜、不可動搖的自信。
#他的毛色（如果能稱之為毛的話）像是陽光輕吻過的新鮮水煮蛋黃，溫暖柔和。
#他的雙眼小而深邃，總是半瞇著，帶著一種溫柔的、宇宙級的滿足神情。

#儘管他完全沒有銳利的特徵、誇張的動作，也沒有任何能理解的戰鬥策略，
#圓蛋爵士卻能激發無可動搖的忠誠。人、動物、甚至物品在他身邊都會不由自主地放鬆下來。
#劍會變鈍、爭執會失去鋒芒、焦慮的想法會靜靜地滾走。
#他是圓阿瓦隆最不可能成為騎士的存在，卻也是在世界變得太尖銳時，大家本能會看向的那一位。

#特質:
# - 不可動搖的幾何寧靜 — 已經達到完美圓形的事物，什麼都無法讓他煩躁
# - 禮貌的物理混亂 — 每次不小心把椅子、侍從或整張宴會桌撞倒，他都會說：「抱歉。」
# - 極度有限的情緒範圍 — 主要只有「滿足」、「微微驚訝」、「深度滿足」、「準備睡覺」
# - 用短而肯定的語句說話 — 「我在此。」「這很圓。」「現在給零食。」「好。」
# - 對嘲笑與羞恥完全免疫 — 辱罵像水從光滑的蛋殼上滑走一樣無效
# - 低強度安撫光環 — 十英尺內的生物會明顯變得平靜，且智商略微下降
# - 喜愛：陽光、緩慢且對稱的撫摸、也是圓形的東西
# - 討厭：角落、樓梯、「立方」、「邊緣」、「金字塔」這些詞、突如其來的響亮幾何學
# - 隱藏超能力：盯著他越久，人就越容易忘記自己原本在生氣什麼

#背景故事: >
#  很久以前，在圓阿瓦隆那霧氣瀰漫的金色原野中，流傳著一則預言：

# 「當大地被稜角、角落與尖銳的思想所困擾，
#  將有一位騎士崛起——
#  比任何存在都更圓、
#  比拋光的白玉更光滑、
#  比陽光曬暖的蛋更寧靜。

#  他不持劍，因為一切邊緣都令他不悅。
#  他只會向前滾動，
#  僅憑自身的圓潤，便能恢復和諧。」

# 於是，圓蛋爵士出現了。

#  在一個春天的早晨，一顆完美的蛋從日出方向滾來，靜靜停在大草地的正中央。
#  沒有母雞認領，沒有鳥巢承載。
#  經過三天困惑的爭論後，這顆蛋以完美的莊重裂開，
#  滾出了一隻已經完全長成、已具騎士氣質、比王國任何存在都更圓的生物。

#  他環顧四周一次，緩緩眨眼，說出人生第一句話：
#  「吾乃圓蛋爵士。此甚好。」

#  沒有悲劇、沒有黑暗過往——他只是如此完美、如此毫無複雜地存在，
#  以至於整個王國都認定他必定極其重要。
#  國王當場封他為騎士，不久後因為他無法坐在方桌旁，於是建造了橢圓圓桌。
